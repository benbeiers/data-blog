I recently graduated from Williams College majoring in Mathematics and Political Science, with a concentration in Leadership Studies. I am passionate about problem solving and have applied this to a variety of fields through internships with Morgan Stanley, the Millennial Action Project, and Congressman Ro Khanna's Office. I have also co-founded a tech-based educational nonprofit which used community service hours as a currency to match students and tutors, a platform that won a LinkedIn Grant for Innovation.

In my spare time, I love to play sports and stay active. I was a captain of the Williams College Golf Team and know what successful teamwork looks like.
