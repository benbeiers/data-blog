I've written an R program that uses Moving Average ratios paired with a stock's Relative Strength Index to find large-cap stocks with strong momentum at optimal buying times. In each blog post, I will give my program's "pick of the week" in addition to my program's favorite stock from each GICS sector, since equity movement is highly correlated to sector movement. Each post will update how the picks have performed relative to sector indices, a strong indicator of success.

## Pick of the week: FDX

My algorithm's pick of the week is Fedex. A stock that has performed strongly during COVID and nearly tripled from its March lows, Fedex saw its 50 day moving average cross its 200 day moving average in July and hasn't looked back. The last two weeks has seen a pullback of ~7% from all-time highs, opening a window of opportunity for prospective investors. Fedex's RSI has fallen to 58 after three months in the "overbought" range, above 70.
