I've written an R program that uses Moving Average ratios weighted by Relative Strength Index to find large-cap stocks with strong momentum at optimal buying times. In a weekly blog series, I will give my program's "pick of the week" in addition to its favorite stock from every other GICS sector. Every post will update how my stocks have performed relative to indices, a strong indicator of success.

## Recap

Week one was a huge success, largely due to huge weeks from L Brands (LB) and The Mosaic Company (MOS). Just six of eleven stock picks found themselves in the negative for the week, despite the S&P 500 declining 1.66%. Here's how the individual stocks performed:

To track this algorithm, I've decided to start with $11,000 split evenly between the eleven GICS sectors. Each week, the value of the portfolio will be calculated and redistributed evenly between the eleven new stocks. After week one, here is how my algorithm's portolio stands, as compared to the S&P 500:

The portfolio generated by this algorithm found itself up 1.06% this week and made $118.20, as compared to SPX's $182.60 loss. On to week two!

## Pick of the week: Fedex (FDX)

My algorithm's pick of the week is Fedex. An Industrials stock that has performed strongly during COVID and nearly tripled from its March lows, Fedex saw its 50 day moving average cross its 200 day moving average in July and hasn't looked back. The last two weeks has seen a pullback of ~7% from all-time highs, opening a window of opportunity for prospective investors. Fedex's RSI has fallen to 58 after three months in the "overbought" range above 70.
